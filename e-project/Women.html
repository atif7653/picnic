          <h2>Basic Tug of War Rules</h2> <br>
          <br>
          <h3>*The Rope </h3> <br>
          <br>
          The game involves usage of single equipment i.e. a rope. There is a red mark made in the
          middle of the rope. This red mark on the rope needs to be at a perpendicular angle to the exact
          center point on the ground, before the commencement of the game. A white mark is made
          exactly 13 feet from the red mark on either sides of the rope. The game is won when either side
          with this white mark crosses the center point. <br>
          <h2>*Teams</h2> <br>
          According to the rules of tug of war, each team can accommodate a maximum of 8 members.
          However the combined weight of these members should not exceed the weight determined for
          the particular category. <br>

          <h2>*Field and Marking</h2> <br>
          The game has to be played on a flat grassy patch of land. A line referred to as a center line is
          marked on the playing zone and the rope is placed in a manner that its center mark should align
          the center marked on the ground. On either sides of the rope at the distance of 4 m from the
          center line, 2 more marks need to be made. This is the point where in the first member of each
          team will stand. <br>
          <h2>*How to Play</h2> <br>
          As mentioned earlier, the center of the rope should align with the center marked on the
          ground. As soon as the referee blows the whistle, each team can start pulling the rope into their
          territory. The objective of the game is for each team to pull the rope along with the members of
          opposition team to their side. As soon as the second mark on the rope from the center red
          mark crosses over to center line, the team to pull the rope to their area wins the game.</p>

          <h2>Cornhole Game Play</h2> <br>
          1.Two teams of two people, termed partners, shall play. Partners shall stand at opposite cornhole boxes on
          the same side, from the perspective of a third person, and face each other, so there is no advantage given
          to one team.
          <br> 2.Each cornhole team shall have 4 bags of one color.
          <br> 3.All 8 cornhole bags begin at one end.
          <br> 4.A coin flip shall determine which cornhole team has honors in round one.
          <br> 5.One of the partners on the team who has honors shall begin play by throwing a cornhole bag at the
          opposite cornhole box.
          <br> 6.A cornhole player may throw from anywhere behind the front of the cornhole box they are throwing
          from.
          <br> 7.Game continues by alternating throws between the two opponent players until all 8 cornhole bags have
          been thrown.
          <br> 8.If a cornhole bag hits the ground then bounces up onto the board, that bag shall be taken off the
          playing surface.
          <br> 9.The next round starts when the other cornhole player on the team, which has honors, throws their
          first cornhole bag.
          <br> 10.The cornhole game continues until one team reaches 21 or more points. <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Cornhole Game Scoring</h2> <br>
          1.The score shall be taken after all cornhole bags have been thrown for a round.
          <br>2.Points shall be given as follows.
          <br>3.points for a cornhole bag that goes through the hole.
          <br>4.point for a cornhole bag that is on the playing surface.
          <br>5.point for a cornhole bag that is hanging into the hole.
          <br>6.point for a cornhole bag that is hanging off the edge but not touching the ground.
          <br>7.points for a cornhole bag that is on the playing surface, but also touching the ground.
          <br>8.points for a cornhole bag that is hanging off the front edge and is resting on a cornhole bag that is
          on the ground (unless the cornhole bag on the ground can be removed without making the hanging bag fall to
          the ground, then one point is given).
          <br>9.The cornhole team with the highest round score, adds the difference of the two scores to their game
          score.</p>

            <h2>Hide & Seek</h2><br>
            This is a favourite and familiar game that can be played over and over again. It’s a great way to develop
            social skills and positive relationships with others. <br>
            <h3>Age Group:</h3> All ages
            <h3>Activity instructions:</h3>
            Here’s a bunch of variations to the game Hide & Seek
            <h3>Standard Hide & Seek</h3>
            One person is the “seeker” and everybody else are the “hiders”. The seeker closes their eyes and
            counts to an agreed upon number (i.e. 50). When the counting is done, the seeker opens their eyes
            and says “Ready or not, here I come” and the seeking begins. Once a hider is found, they will go to
            a designated spot until everyone has been discovered.
            <h3>Sardines</h3>
            This is “Hide & Seek” in reverse. One person is the “hider” and everybody else are the “seekers”.
            Everyone except the hider close their eyes and count. When the counting is done, all the seekers
            scatter and start searching for the hider. If one player finds the hider, then they join them in their
            hiding position. When the next person finds the two hiders, they join them etc. When the game is
            over, everyone is squished into the hiding place like a can of sardines!
            <h3>Hide Teddy</h3>
            There are a few ways to play this game. Create a
            team of hiders and another team of seekers. Hiders
            hide their stuffed toy and time the seekers. Another
            way is to have one person hide the toy and
            everyone else go seeking. You can add a
            “hotter/colder” aspect to the game. The closer the
            seeker gets to the toy the “hotter” it gets to be found. </p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
          <div class="card" style="width: 100%;" data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="3000">

              <p class="card-text">
              <h2>Hot Dog Eating Contest Rules</h2>
              The rules are simple: Get as many hot dogs down as possible in the 10-minute time limit. And keep them
              down, because vomiting is an automatic disqualification. <br>
              <br>
              Many competitors dip their dogs in water to soften the bread. That strategy is a proven winner, though
              contestants can only soak their dogs for a maximum of five seconds. <br>
              <br>
              Don’t expect to see the grace and elegance you would find at a Cotillion class. Contestants are not
              permitted to use utensils during the race to eat as many wieners as they can, although they likely
              wouldn’t anyway since it would only slow them down. <br>
              <br>
              However, competitors must eat the hot dogs in a certain order and may not move on to a new plate until
              the previous one is wiped clean. <br>
              <br>
              Don’t worry about the age-old “mustard or ketchup?” debate, either. Condiments can’t be layered on the
              dogs. Beer (or any other alcoholic beverage) also can’t be used to wash down the Independence Day
              meal. <br>
              <br>
              <h2>How to Bet on Hot Dog Eating Contest</h2>
              Betting on the hot dog eating contest was allowed for the first time in 2020. Since then, sports betting
              states such as Arizona, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Colorado and Michigan have all made it legal for
              licensed sportsbooks to accept wagers on the event. <br>
              <br>
              It’s worth noting that you can’t bet on the contest
              in New York where the event is held, as the state doesn’t allow gambling on “non-sporting events.” <br>
              <br>
              It’s safe to say professional eaters would argue that the contest is a sport. <br>
              <br>
              Wagers come in different forms. Bettors can pick which contestant in the field will be the one to walk
              away with the Mustard Belt, how many hot dogs will be eaten and if there will be a record amount of dogs
              and buns eaten.</p>
